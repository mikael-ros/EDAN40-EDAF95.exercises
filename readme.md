# EDAN40/EDAF95 Exercises
> [!NOTE]
> I am currently lagging slightly behind, be patient as I go through the course work.

In this repo you will find solutions to the exercises given by the book Programming in Haskell Second Edition as part of the course literature recommended by the course [EDAN40](https://cs.lth.se/edan40) at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, as well as handpicked exercises from the lecturer. Some of these are common to the course [EDAF95](https://cs.lth.se/edaf95). 

For the classes, under the folder ``exercises/malec``, theres also solutions on the official page. Similarly, there might also be more information on those exercises under their original sources, as this years lecturer Jacek Malec based the exercises on a compilation of original sources, listed in the corresponding classes.

This is a complementary resource to my [Notion notes database](https://mikaelrr.notion.site/Delade-anteckningar-Hub-LTH-D-C-f2a47297b9b146dba372e02c4f789d55?pvs=4).

> [!NOTE]
> I will probably not go back and edit older assignments, unless I've made an error large enough or couldn't complete a task back when I did it. Feel free to contribute and fix errors.
> Note that no solutions to the assignments will be provided, for obvious reasons.

## Usage

### Load module
```console
$ ghci

$ GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
$ ghci > :l file.hs
```
After which you can run methods defined within the file.
### Testing with HUnit
This is experimental, I still haven't gotten this to work. When it does, however, it should be possible to run the tests file with any of the prior methods.
