# EDAN40/EDAF95 Exercises
> [!NOTE]
> I am currently lagging slightly behind, be patient as I go through the course work.

In this repo you will find solutions to the exercises given by the book Programming in Haskell Second Edition as part of the course literature* recommended by the course [EDAN40](https://cs.lth.se/edan40)** at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, as well as handpicked exercises from the lecturer. Some of these are common to the course [EDAF95](https://cs.lth.se/edaf95). 

For the classes, under the folder ``exercises/malec``, theres also solutions on the official page. Similarly, there might also be more information on those exercises under their original sources, as this years lecturer Jacek Malec based the exercises on a compilation of original sources, listed in the corresponding classes.

This is a complementary resource to my [Notion notes database](https://mikaelrr.notion.site/Delade-anteckningar-Hub-LTH-D-C-f2a47297b9b146dba372e02c4f789d55?pvs=4).

> [!NOTE]
> I will probably not go back and edit older assignments, unless I've made an error large enough or couldn't complete a task back when I did it. Feel free to contribute and fix errors.
> Note that no solutions to the assignments will be provided, for obvious reasons.

> ``*`` specifically referring to the book "Programming in Haskell" (second edition), written by Graham Hutton and published in 2016 - my copy was printed 2021. ISBN ``978-1-316-62622-1``. Find it cheapest by referring to a tool like ``bokfynd.se`` (unaffiliated, just like the site) - book entry [here](https://www.bokfynd.nu/9781316626221/programming-in-haskell/). It is possible that these exercises are compatible with the previous version, please let me know.

## Usage

### Load module
```console
ghci

GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
ghci > :l file.hs
```
After which you can run methods defined within the file.
### Testing
Some modules have tests included, usually the soltions for the book.

The modules are tested with HUnit, which you can find [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit). A guide can be found [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/HUnit_1.0_User%27s_Guide).
#### Stack
1. Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/), if not present
2. Run the following: in your terminal (not GHCi)
```console
stack install HUnit
```
> [!NOTE]
> You can probably use cabal, but I found Stack to be easier.
#### Executing tests
Tests are run by running 
```haskell
ghci> :l <testsmodule>
ghci> runTestTT <testlist>
```
Where ``<testsmodule>`` is the module containing the tests and ``<testlist>`` is any lists of tests currently loaded. I try to name them in UpperCamelCase and lowerCamelCase with the same name in general.

This should then return something like (if the tests pass):
```console
Cases: 4  Tried: 4  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
Counts {cases = 4, tried = 4, errors = 0, failures = 0}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to reload the test module in ghci when changing methods in the source file

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute small fixes or optimizations to any code. I will likely accept pull requests if they are limited in scope or if they provide solutions for exercises I have chosen not to do. Pull requests containing code that is vastly different from mine, using methods I don't understand or that are poorly documented will not be accepted. Similarly any type of plagiarism is not welcome.

Generally I try to stick to methods discussed in a module or chapter when solving the exercises for that module/chapter even if I have progressed further, as to not confuse others - please try to adhere to this as well :)

Happy Haskell...ing? yeah :)
