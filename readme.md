# EDAN40/EDAF95 Exercises
In this repo you will find solutions to the exercises given by the book Programming in Haskell Second Edition as part of the course litterature recommended by the course [EDAN40](https://cs.lth.se/edan40) at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, as well as handpicked exercises from the lecturer. Some of these are common to the course [EDAF95](https://cs.lth.se/edaf95).

This is a complementary resource to my [Notion notes database](https://mikaelrr.notion.site/Delade-anteckningar-Hub-LTH-D-C-f2a47297b9b146dba372e02c4f789d55?pvs=4).
