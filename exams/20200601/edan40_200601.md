# Exam 2020-06-01

## 1
Rewrite the following two definitions into a point-free form, using neither lambda-expressions nor list comprehensions nor enumeration nor where-clause nor let-clause:
```haskell
f x y = x / (5 - y)
g x y = [x z | z <- [3,7..y]]
```

---

## 2
Provide the types and explain the results of applying the following functions: ``seq``, ``pseq``, ``par``.

---

## 3
What is the effect and type of:

3.1. ``uncurry ($)``

3.2. ``uncurry (:)``

3.3. ``uncurry (.)``

3.4. ``uncurry uncurry``

3.5. ``curry uncurry``

---

## 4
The definition of a Functor class looks as follows:
```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```
As we know, the functors to behave correctly should obey the following functor laws:
```haskell
fmap id = id
fmap (f . g) = (fmap f) . (fmap g)
```
Define an incorrect functor of your choice, i.e., provide a correct Haskell code defining a functor in such a way that the functor laws are NOT satisfied. Show that the laws do not hold.

---
## 5
Implement a data structure for sets over an arbitrary type ``a``, with the following operations:
```haskell
union, intersection, difference :: Set a -> Set a -> Set a
cartesian_product :: Set a -> Set b -> Set (a, b)
member :: a -> Set a -> Bool
insert :: a -> Set a -> Set a
```
Make sure that your ``Set`` is a functor, by providing proper declaration for this property.
